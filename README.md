R code and example dataset of analysis for paper "Prioritization of Fluorescence in Situ Hybridization (FISH) Probes for Differentiating Primary Sites of Neuroendocrine Tumors with Machine Learning"
Reference:


This repository is for public access of example R code used for the machine learning analysis for the neuroendocrine tumor dataset presented in the above publication for classification of pNET and sbNET subtypes.
The R code presented includes a condensed example of the primary analyses performed in the publication, including fitting of models, imputation and transformation strategies, and the consensus model.
Parameters included in the models for grid search tuning are meant to be an example of how tuning was performed in the published analysis.
The example dataset in the file Example_Dataset.csv is an artificial dataset for displaying the structure of the full dataset analyzed in the publication. This dataset has 20 samples and may produce some warnings by the example R code due to the small sample size.
